> **Current Status:** 🚧 **Paused temporarily.** Development is on hold during the University of Aveiro (UA) exam season. Regular updates will resume in February.

## 📖 About the Project
**DETI Dungeons** is a turn-based strategy RPG built from scratch using **Python**. 
The main goal of this project is to apply advanced programming concepts such as **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**, state management, and algorithm logic (damage calculation, turn flow) without relying on heavy game engines.

While the initial version runs on the CLI (Command Line Interface) to ensure solid logic, the final version will feature a GUI built with **Pygame**.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
*   **Language:** Python 3.x
*   **Libraries:** Pygame (GUI implementation)
*   **Concepts:** OOP, Data Structures, Event Handling.

## 🗺️ Roadmap & Features
Based on the long-term development plan:

### Phase 1: The Core (Terminal Logic)
- [X] Character & Enemy Class Structure (Attributes: HP, Attack, Defense, Mana).
- [X] Turn-Based Combat Loop (Input/Output).
- [ ] Damage Calculation Logic & Win/Loss Conditions.

### Phase 2: Graphical Interface (Pygame)
- [ ] Window Configuration & Asset Rendering.
- [ ] Visual Combat Loop (Replacing text printouts with UI elements).
- [ ] Interactive Action Buttons (Attack, Magic).

### Phase 3: Expansion & Polish
- [ ] Leveling System (XP & Progression).
- [ ] Multiple Enemy Types & AI logic.
- [ ] Magic/Ability System implementation.

### Phase 4: Web Integration (Experimental)
- [ ] Save/Load System (JSON/Pickle serialization).
- [ ] *Future Goal:* Web visualization using HTML/CSS/JS.
